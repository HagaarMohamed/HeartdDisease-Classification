# Heart Disease Prediction: Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an analysis and predictive modeling of the **Heart Disease** dataset. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical data of patients and is widely used for predicting heart disease. The features in the dataset include medical and personal information which are relevant for diagnosing heart disease.


## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease based on their medical attributes.


### Prerequisites

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
